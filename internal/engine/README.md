## Engine Package

The engine package is a complete chess engine that implements the UCI protocol.
UCI engines are stateless and just calculate legal moves from a given position.
The engine is GUI agnostic, meaning it can be used with any GUI that supports the UCI protocol.
Should fully contain logic for:

- Bitboards
- Board
- Moves
- Pieces
- Checks
- Checkmates
